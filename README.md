# FavoriteRecipeWebpage

Create a simple webpage that displays your favorite recipe. The webpage should include the following elements:

1) A heading that displays the recipe name.
2) An image of the finished dish.
3) An unordered list of ingredients.
4) A paragraph of instructions.


In the code, make sure to replace the following parts with your own content:
* <title>My Favorite Recipe</title>: Replace "My Favorite Recipe" with the title of your recipe.
* <h1>Recipe Name</h1>: Replace "Recipe Name" with the actual name of your recipe.
* <img src="image.jpg" alt="Dish Image">: Replace "image.jpg" with the filename and extension of your dish image, and provide an appropriate alt text.
* <li>Ingredient 1</li>, <li>Ingredient 2</li>, etc.: Replace "Ingredient 1", "Ingredient 2", etc. with the actual ingredients of your recipe.
* <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>: Replace the placeholder text with the actual instructions for your recipe.


Once you've customized the HTML code to fit your recipe, save it as an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see how it looks.
