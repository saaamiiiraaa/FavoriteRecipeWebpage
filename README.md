# FavoriteRecipeWebpage

Create a simple webpage that displays your favorite recipe. The webpage should include the following elements:

1) A heading that displays the recipe name.
2) An image of the finished dish.
3) An unordered list of ingredients.
4) A paragraph of instructions.


Once you've customized the HTML code to fit your recipe, save it as an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see how it looks.
